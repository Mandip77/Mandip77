Hello there!
My name is Mandip Amgain, and I am an associate's degree candidate in computer science at Bunker Hill Community College.
I intend to transfer to a four-year university to earn my bachelor's degree when I complete my associate's.
Technology has always piqued my interest, and I enjoy picking up new programming languages and frameworks.
HTML, CSS, Linux, JavaScript, Java, and Python are a few of the skills I've learned.
I am continually looking for ways to enhance and broaden my knowledge, and I am open to discovering new things.
